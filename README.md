# Gificiency

Become more GIF-efficient.

## Requirements

- Server running PHP/Apache

## Installation

- Download the ZIP of all the files
- Open up `config.php` and edit the `$url` and `$dir` directories (see below)
- Upload the entire `gificiency-master` directory contents to your server

The `$url` variable is the URL to your application, and the `$dir` variable is a 
relative path (from the directory you uploaded the files to) to where you are storing 
the media (GIFs, images).
